## Overview

**NexSlice** is a modular, open-source testbed for 5G core network slicing built natively on Kubernetes. It supports scalable slice instantiation using open-source components such as **OpenAirInterface (OAI)** and **UERANSIM**, and integrates both monolithic and disaggregated RANs.

This repository contains Helm charts and deployment scripts for:
- OAI 5G SA Core
- OAI disaggregated CU/DU RAN with NR-UEs
- UERANSIM simulator for gNBs and UEs
- Slice-aware orchestration using **SetpodNet**
- Monitoring via **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Lens**

Slicing is implemented by mapping UEs to unique **S-NSSAI** identifiers (SST, SD), with dedicated SMF/UPF instances per slice and shared AMF/NSSF/AUSF/UDM/UDR. This setup enables reproducible experiments across isolated, service-tailored network slices (eMBB, URLLC, etc.).

# Build a K8S cluster
We assume that a Kubernetes cluster is already running using this repository: https://github.com/AIDY-F2N/k8s-cluster-setup-ubuntu24.git

# Tools Setup

1.  Install the Helm CLI usnig this link: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

Helm CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a command-line tool used for managing applications on Kubernetes clusters. It is part of the Helm package manager, which helps you package, deploy, and manage applications as reusable units called Helm charts.

Helm provides a straightforward way to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications. With Helm, you can define the desired state of your application using a declarative YAML-based configuration file called a Helm chart. A Helm chart contains all the necessary Kubernetes manifests, configurations, and dependencies required to deploy and run your application.

2.  Install Helm Spray using this command: 
```bash[language=bash]
helm plugin install https://github.com/ThalesGroup/helm-spray
```
Helm Spray is a Helm plugin that simplifies the deployment of Kubernetes applications using Helm charts. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and manage applications as reusable units called charts. Helm Spray extends Helm's functionality by providing additional features and capabilities for managing the lifecycle of complex deployments. The command helm plugin install installs the Helm Spray plugin, enabling you to use its functionalities alongside Helm.

3. Clone Multus GitHub repository:
```bash[language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni.git
```
  - Apply a daemonset which installs Multus using kubectl. From the root directory of the clone, apply the daemonset YAML file:
    ```bash[language=bash]
    kubectl apply -f multus-cni/deployments/multus-daemonset-thick.yml
    ```
4. Create nexslice namespace using the below command: 
    ```bash[language=bash]
    kubectl create ns nexslice
    ```

5. Clone this repository:
```bash[language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/AIDY-F2N/NexSlice.git
```

6. Install Metrics Server:
To enable auto-scaling features like HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), deploy the Kubernetes metrics server:
```bash[language=bash]
kubectl apply -f metricserver.yaml
```


# OAI 5G SA Core Deployment
1. Open a terminal inside the folder "NexSlice" and deploy [setpodnet-scheduler](https://github.com/AIDY-F2N/setpodnet-scheduler) using the following command:

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl apply -f setpodnet-scheduler.yaml
```

2. (Optional) To optimize performance—especially for latency-sensitive components like the User Plane Function (UPF)—you can specify inter-VNF constraints directly in their Helm values file.
Example: In the values.yaml file of the UPF (located in 5g_core/oai-5g-advance/oai-upf/), add the following annotations:

```yaml
annotations:
  communication-with: "oai-amf,oai-smf"
  latency-oai-amf: "10"
  bandwidth-oai-amf: "1"
  latency-oai-smf: "10"
  bandwidth-oai-smf: "1"
```
These annotations inform the scheduler about preferred communication paths and required QoS between UPF, AMF, and SMF.

3. Run the following commands to deploy the 5g core:
```bash[language=bash]
helm dependency update 5g_core/oai-5g-advance/
helm install 5gc 5g_core/oai-5g-advance/ -n nexslice
```
These commands update chart dependencies and deploy the full OAI 5G SA Core into your cluster.

To confirm the deployment status of the core components:
```bash[language=bash]
kubectl get pods -n nexslice 
```

# Radio Access Networks (RANs)
NexSlice supports the deployment of two types of 5G RANs: the disaggregated OpenAirInterface (OAI) RAN and the simulated UERANSIM RAN. These deployments allow testing slicing capabilities in both realistic and emulated environments.

## OAI Disaggregated 5G RAN
This setup launches the OAI RAN components—CU-CP, CU-UP, and DU—with support for SST-based slicing (e.g., SST 1–3). It also deploys multiple OAI NR-UEs, each assigned to a specific slice.

```bash[language=bash]
helm install cucp 5g_ran/dis_ran_gnb1/oai-cu-cp/ -n nexslice
helm install cuup 5g_ran/dis_ran_gnb1/oai-cu-up -n nexslice
helm install du 5g_ran/dis_ran_gnb1/oai-du -n nexslice

helm install nrue1 5g_ran/oai-nr-ue1 -n nexslice 
helm install nrue2 5g_ran/oai-nr-ue2 -n nexslice

kubectl get pods -n nexslice | grep -E 'cu-cp|cu-up|du|nr-ue'
```

You can verify that NR-UEs received an IP address using:

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl exec -it -n nexslice -c nr-ue $(kubectl get pods -n nexslice | grep oai-nr-ue | awk '{print $1}') -- ifconfig oaitun_ue1 |grep -E '(^|\s)inet($|\s)' | awk {'print $2'}
kubectl exec -it -n nexslice -c nr-ue $(kubectl get pods -n nexslice | grep oai-nr-ue2 | awk '{print $1}') -- ifconfig oaitun_ue1 |grep -E '(^|\s)inet($|\s)' | awk {'print $2'}
```
To confirm successful connection to the Internet:

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl exec -it -n nexslice -c nr-ue $(kubectl get pods -n nexslice | grep oai-nr-ue | awk '{print $1}') -- ping -I oaitun_ue1 -c4 google.fr
kubectl exec -it -n nexslice -c nr-ue $(kubectl get pods -n nexslice | grep oai-nr-ue2 | awk '{print $1}') -- ping -I oaitun_ue1 -c4 google.fr
```

## UERANSIM Deployment

UERANSIM (User Equipment and RAN Simulator) is an open-source 5G simulator that emulates both the gNB and UE functionalities. It enables testing mobility, session setup, slicing behavior, and QoS in a lightweight environment.

```bash[language=bash]
helm install ueransim-gnb 5g_ran/ueransim-gnb2/ -n nexslice

helm install ueransim-ue1 5g_ran/ueransim-ue1/ -n nexslice
helm install ueransim-ue2 5g_ran/ueransim-ue2/ -n nexslice
helm install ueransim-ue3 5g_ran/ueransim-ue3/ -n nexslice
```

Check running pods:

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl get pods -n nexslice | grep ueransim
kubectl logs -n nexslice <ueransim-gnb name> 
```
<div align="center">
    <img src="fig/ueransim.png" alt="OAI-RAN">
</div>

View logs:

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl logs -n nexslice <ueransim-ue name>
```
<div align="center">
    <img src="fig/ueransim2.png" alt="OAI-RAN">
</div>
Same commande could be used to test other UEs

Test data session by pinging from a UE:

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl exec -it -n nexslice <ueransim-ue name> -- ping -c 3 -I uesimtun0 google.com
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="fig/ueransim3.png" alt="OAI-RAN">
</div>
Same commande could be used to test other UEs

# Monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus
To enable observability of the system, NexSlice integrates Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for real-time visualization of the cluster, network slices, and VNF behavior.

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl create ns monitoring
helm install monitoring monitoring/ -n monitoring
```

Now you should be able to access the Grafana dashboard. You can use port forwarding using the following command (Replace <grafana-pod-name> by the name of your grafana pod )

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring <grafana-pod-name> 3000 &
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="fig/monitoring.png" alt="OAI-RAN">
</div>


Make sure the port is allowed in the firewall to be accessed from your workstation.

You will be able to access Grafana a from http://localhost:3000
```bash[language=bash]
User: admin
Password: prom-operator
```

# Advanced Tests: Scaling UEs and Measuring Throughput
NexSlice enables large-scale experimentation with slicing and traffic generation using UERANSIM. Below we describe how to deploy and test 100 simultaneous UEs.

1. If UERANSIM gNB or UEs are already running, uninstall them:
```bash[language=bash]
helm ls-n nexslice
helm uninstall -n nexslice <ueransim-gnb> <ueransim-ue1> ...
```

2. Here's a simple way to deploy a large number of UEs. Enable UE creation and set the number of UEs to 100:

```bash[language=bash]
helm install ueransim-gnb 5g_ran/ueransim-gnb2/ -n nexslice \
  --set ues.enabled=true \
  --set ues.count=100
```

This will create two pods: one containing the ueransim-gnb, and the other hosting all the UEs.
```bash[language=bash]
kubectl get pods -n nexslice | grep ueransim
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="fig/100ues.png" alt="AIDY-F2N">
</div>

You can verify the deployment either by checking the logs of ueransim-gnb or by accessing the UE pod to view the interfaces from uesimtun0 to uesimtun99. Each should have an IP address and be able to ping:

```bash[language=bash]
kubectl logs -n nexslice <ueransim-gnb-pod-name>
kubectl exec -n nexslice <ueransim-ues-pod-name> -- ip a
kubectl exec -n nexslice <ueransim-ues-pod-name> -- ping -c 4 -I uesimtun0 google.com
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="fig/100ues_test.png" alt="AIDY-F2N">
</div>

## Ping Traffic Test

Use the provided script to send ping requests from each UE:

```bash[language=bash]
chmod +x tests/ping.sh
./tests/ping.sh 
```
All UEs will attempt to ping a target (e.g., google.com) from their respective virtual interfaces.

## iPerf3 Throughput Test

1. Deploy iperf3 server using the following command : 
```bash[language=bash]
kubectl run iperf3 --image=maitaba/iperf3:latest
```

iperf3 pod acts as server which is listening to 100 ports from 5201 to 5301. By default, the iPerf3 server will listen to all active interfaces of the host for new connections. 


2.  Run the following script, UEs will act as clients to connect with the server (at most 100) and connect to an iperf3 server during &lt;seconds&gt; seconds.   
```bash[language=bash]
chmod +x tests/iperf.sh
./tests/iperf.sh <secondes> #60 seconds by default 
```
